#Multi-line strings can be used when trying to put multiple sentences to stand alone in python


#Concatenations are basically when you try to add multiple strings together usin the "+" symbol

print("Hi" + "I'm" + "Jason")
#When you run this line directly aove this comment the way it is, the result is : Hi I'm Jason, Like literally. So you need to add spaces within the quotes of the strings like:

print("I"+ " like" + " bread")

#OR
print("Hi" + "\nI'm" + " \nJason")
#The character "\n" is known as a new line indicator

#python also has word problems. For example:
print("I will learn Python\n" * 1000)
