## 📖 About This Project

I started this repo as a way to document my progress learning **Python programming** and exploring the world of **Linux**, inspired by the energy and teaching style of [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) on YouTube.

Here you’ll find:
- Python practice scripts
- Linux command-line experiments
- Notes & examples from NetworkChuck’s tutorials
- My own experiments inspired by his videos

It’s not perfect — it’s just my playground as I learn and have fun!
